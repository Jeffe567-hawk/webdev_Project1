  <h1>Favorite Media</h1>
  <img class="imageR" src="images/Rezero.jpg" alt="Cover image of ReZero">
  <p>I have a lot of media that I watch and play, but one of my most favorite media that I watch is ReZero. ReZero is an anime where the main permise is the main character named Subaru goes to a different world and has the power where the main character returns from death and returns to a checkpoint.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of things I like about the anime like the characters, the music, the animation, and the story.
  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>The story of ReZero is that the main character named Subaru is taken to a different world and is given an power that we don't find out until later. He is aware that he is taken to another world and tries to help people but he realise pretty quickly that he is the same in turns of strength and that he can't use magic yet. After that he gets cornered into an ally but some thugs and then get help from his main love interest. Since he doesn't have a real goal yet Subaru ask to help her out since she is looking for something that is stolen from her that is very important. He ask her for her name where she tell him that it's Satella and they do some more searching. Later on, they find out out where the person who took the item went and then Subaru goes inside the building first to check it out, when this happpens we see Subaru drop down on the floor and we see a large deep cut on his stomach. After this Satella enters the building after him and then dies as she walks in before Subaru can warn her. Before Subaru dies he promises Satella that he will save her and then grabs her hand. When he finally dies we see that he went back in time and he is the only person who remembers anything. He is first disoriented, but later see Satella and runs to her and calls her name. She then stops and listens to what he says and then she gets mad saying that he called her the witch of envy and that name is taboo.</p>
  <p>This is only the first episode and it really hooks you in with the mysteries of the world like of is the witch of envy and how the main charcter has the powers that he has and how it works.</p>
  <h2>Music</h2>
  <p>Another thing I like about ReZero is the music, there are many differnt types of music that it plays during the anime that fit the scene that it wants to convey</p>
  <p>One of my favorite is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iu_0kOfMGD0">Paradisus-Paradoxum</a> it's a opening that plays during the second season during the anime that is one of the more hype up music that the anime plays, but one of the more emotional songs that plays during the anime is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-LQqnyNYiQ">Requiem of Silence</a>. It's a very emotional song that plays during one of the scenes of the anime that really makes you feel the helplessness and the dispare of the main character.</p>
  <h2>Characters</h2>
  <p>There are many characters in Rezero and they all likable in their own way, whether they are evil, good, or neutral they are all good characters and feel like they could be real people. They all have their own flaws and conflicts and the times they do things out of character it's for a reason and no charcter feels like a small character who is just there to be there.</p>
